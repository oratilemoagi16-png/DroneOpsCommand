"""Stripe webhook handler — processes payment events from Stripe.

This endpoint has NO JWT auth — it is called directly by Stripe and
verified via the webhook signature.

ADR-0009 — `checkout.session.completed` is now phase-aware. The
session's `metadata.payment_phase` selects the destination columns
(deposit_* vs the existing paid_in_full path) and the notification
shape (deposit-received email vs balance-paid email). Sessions without
the metadata key fall through to the legacy single-payment path so any
checkout session in flight at the v2.65.0 cutover continues to work.

v2.66.0 (Fix 2) — A SignatureVerificationError now fires an `urgent`
ntfy alert (5-minute Redis-backed cooldown to avoid floods) before the
HTTP 400 is raised. Without this, a webhook-secret rotation that the
DB falls behind on would silently drop every paid customer event with
no operator visibility.
