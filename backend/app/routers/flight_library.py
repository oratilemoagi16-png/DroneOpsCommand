    - ``YYYYMMDD`` — the flight's calendar date in the **operator's local**

      stored UTC instant rolls past midnight is still named for the local day.
    - ``XXXX`` — the flight's **start-time rank within its own
      (label, operator-local day) group**, zero-padded to 4 digits.

    The pre-ADR-0027 implementation was broken three ways: it counted by
    ``created_at`` (ingest time) inside a window built from ``start_time``'s day
    — so when start-day ≠ ingest-day the count returned 0 and every flight
    collided on ``_0001``; it was a fleet-wide "created today" tally rather than
    per-aircraft and start-ordered; and it used a UTC day boundary for the
    window against a Pacific date token (off-by-one). The result was duplicate
    and garbage-ordered names.

    The sequence is the start-time rank: ``1 + (flights in the same group with an
    earlier start_time)``. A trailing **conflict-bump** loop plus the partial
    unique index ``uq_flights_autoname`` (migration 0004) guarantee the name is
    unique even under out-of-order imports or two airframes sharing a model
    label on the same day. The group key is the *name prefix* (label + local

    (``parse_device_flight_task``). Per-file flow:

    1. Stream the file to disk via ``_spool_upload`` (persists original bytes +
       computes SHA-256 — unchanged path).
    2. **Pre-parse dedup short-circuit** (ADR-0023 §2.1 step 2): if the hash
       already exists, mark the file ``skipped`` with NO job enqueued — the
       common "already synced" case stays instant.
    3. Otherwise enqueue one parse job per file and record it ``queued``.

    Seeds a batch Redis record (``STATUS_QUEUED``) keyed by a server-minted
    ``batch_id`` and returns ``202 + {batch_id, files: [{name, state}]}``.
    Backwards-compatible: old APKs keep hitting the legacy synchronous route.
