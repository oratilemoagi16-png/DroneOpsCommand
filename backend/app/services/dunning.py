"""Automated payment reminders (dunning).

Two customer touches per unpaid invoice:
  - +48h  -> gentle reminder email
  - +7d   -> firmer final-notice email + operator overdue email

Core decision logic (`due_stage`, `process_invoice`) is pure and hermetically
tested. `run_dunning_sweep` is the async orchestration run by the daily Celery
beat task. Idempotent: each stage stamps a timestamp and never re-sends.
